//https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-a-concatenated-string-with-unique-characters/submissions/

This problem can be solved by using backtracking.

Consider this array:   arr = new String[]{"ab", "cd", "cde", "cdef", "efg", "fgh", "abxyz"};

We need to compare each string with every other string. And if the combination of both string is unique, we can find other string
in the array which can be combined with this combination to give maximum length.


Pseudo code:

let concatenate="";
let i=0;

function x(arr, concatenate,i){
 for each s in arr:
   s=concatenate+s;
   check if unique(s)
   if not unique then continue to nepxt string.
   else {
   compare length of new s with max.
   contatenate= x(arr,s, i+1);
   //backtrack contatenate to previous value i.e lastConcatenate.
   concatenate=lastConcatenate.
   }

   }
