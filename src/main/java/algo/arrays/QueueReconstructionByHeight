Approach is to find the list of people with same relative height(say 0) and sort them by their height.

Here height is their actual height and relative height is the height compared to all height.
In [5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]], first index value is height and second index value is relative-height.


Approach:

let relative_height=0
let persons=Find all elements having same relative height and then sort the elements by height
        for each person
            do add it to correct place in the new arraylist(result). To do so, start from end of the persons
            because greater height person should be after shorter height.
            For example: [2,4],[3,4] in first testcase. If we add 2,4 first to array. 3,4 will be added before it in next iteration
            Because  countOfLargerPeople will add it just when 4 persons greater than this person is found.
